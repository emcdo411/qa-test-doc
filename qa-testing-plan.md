## üßæ User Stories

1. **As a cashier**, I want to issue returns from POS so that customers can receive timely refunds.
2. **As a mobile app user**, I want to securely authenticate so that my saved wallet loads on login.
3. **As an inventory manager**, I want item syncs to reflect real-time stock so that I avoid overselling.
4. **As a support analyst**, I want logs to be human-readable so that I can triage issues faster.
